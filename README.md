# Tip Calculator
Practicing Using the JavaScript Ternary Operator

## Description:

My third coding challenge from, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022", was to make a tip calculator that took a dollar amount and determine if the bill is >= $50 && bill <= $300. If the Bill was between $50 - $300 you were to log to the console the bill amount, a 15% tip amount, and the grand total. Anything outside the range of $50 - $300 a 20% tip will be generated. The primary objective of this challenge was to utilize the Ternary Operator, while using Template Literals, and is why $49 or less will generate a tip of 20%. Instead of console.logging the results as requested, I made a little project out of it where the user could enter a custom amount and observe the output statement from their chosen input.

## What I learned:

I learned how to use a Ternary Operator and when to utilize such operator. I also learned how to incorporate Template Literals within Ternary Operators. I ran into an issue where the bill entered by the user was being added to the tip amount (ex: bill $50, tip $7.5, grand total $507.5). As a result, I remembered from my previous challenge that the input from the user was saved as a string. Knowing this, I converted the input from the user to be a number so JavaScript adds the numbers as I visioned.
